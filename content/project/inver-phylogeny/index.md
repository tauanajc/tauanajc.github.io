With more than 40,000 described marine species, gastropods (snails, limpets and slugs) are arguably the most diverse group of invertebrates in the oceans today. With the main lineages diverging over 400 million years ago, deep relationships between major clades remain poorly understood. I use different sequencing approaches and custom bioinformatic pipelines to resolve gastropod relationships at different levels: from ancient divergences between the 5 major gastropod clades [(Cunha & Giribet 2019 Proceedings B)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-a/index.md" >}}) to relationships between subfamilies and genera [(Cunha et al. 2019 MPE)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-b/index.md" >}}).
