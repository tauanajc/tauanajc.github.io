During my undergraduate program at the University of São Paulo, I studied the diversity of invertebrates associated with brown seaweed (*Dictyota* spp.) and their patterns of distribution in time and space [(Cunha et al. 2013 CSR)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2013/index.md" >}}). This project, together with many others from different Brazilian institutions and labs, targeted the Abrolhos Archipelago, the largest and most diverse reef complex of the South Atlantic. This work was done in the [Lab of Deep Sea Ecology and Evolution](http://lamp.io.usp.br) at the University of São Paulo. Broader initiative: [Pró-Abrolhos](http://www3.io.usp.br:48080/lamp/index.php/projetos/todos/11-portugues/principal/projetos-concluidos/95-pro-abrolhos).
