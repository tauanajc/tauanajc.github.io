Just got the wonderful news that my application was selected for a [Faculty for the Future Fellowship](https://www.facultyforthefuture.net)! Recipients are women in STEM fields who may become role models in the sciences upon returning to their home countries. The fellowship will fund the last year of my PhD at Harvard, working with the phylogenetic relationships of gastropods, their biogeography in the marine environment and the evolution of shell shape across large time scales.
