After a great semester with many leading researchers coming to talk to us about all sorts of topics and software on phylogeography and phylogenomics, I got the [Certificate of Distinction in Teaching](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-awards) from the Derek Bok Center for my work at 'Phylogenetics and Phylogeography in the Era of Genomics' (OEB275r) last Fall!
