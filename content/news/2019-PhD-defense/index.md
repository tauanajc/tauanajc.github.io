I am now Dr. Tauana Cunha!

Thank you to family, friends, colleagues and institutions that supported me and my work during the PhD, and to everyone that came for the public presentation. Celebrated in great style with an awesome snail cake by lab friends Caitlin Baker and Vanessa Knutson!

SNAILED IT! =D
