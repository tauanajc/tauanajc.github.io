Returning after four weeks of visiting invertebrate paleontology collections at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, the Natural History Museum in London, and the National Museum of Natural History in Paris! Work: photographing fossil shells from the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. Thanks to all of the collection curators/managers, colleagues and friends that helped and made me company during this time!
